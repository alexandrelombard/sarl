The steps for releasing SARL are:

== 1) PHASE 1: RELEASE CANDIDATE VERSION

=== 1.1) Upgrade all the versions in the pom files and the Eclipse platform

** Upgrade the Eclipse target platform
** Synchronize the versions in the pom files (plugins and dependencies) with the same version numbers as in the Eclipse target platform.
** Synchronize the versions in the pom files within the `tests/sarl-maven-plugin.tests/src/test/resources/projects` folder.

=== 1.2) Compiling locally without error

     $> rm -rf $HOME/.m2/repository
     $> mvn clean install

=== 1.3) Commit all the changes

=== 1.4) Tag the version

* Tag the version with with `vX.Y.Z-rcN`, where `N` is the release candidate number.
* Push the tag on Github.

=== 1.3) Do manual tests

If a manual test is failing, fix the problem, and go to step 1.2.

=== 1.6) Maven Central Bundles

Test the generation of the  bundles for Maven Central:

     $> ./build-tools/scripts/prepare-bundles-for-central.sh

=== 1.7) Javadoc Generation

Test the generation of the Javadoc for the public API (the real generation will be done by the Rake script of the website):

     $> ./build-tools/scripts/generate-aggregate-javadoc.sh

== 2) PHASE 2: RELEASE VERSION

=== 2.1) Remove snapshot markers

Remove all the occurrences of `-SNAPSHOT` in all the poms.

CAUTION: Do not remove the `-SNAPSHOT` in the Groovy scripts.

=== 2.2) Update the versions in the Eclipse configurations

* Remove `.qualifier` in the `MANIFEST.MF` files (in `Bundle-Version`).
* Remove `.qualifier` in the `feature.xml` files (in root tag and in the "sarl" and "janus"" plugins references).
* Remove `.qualifier` in the `*.product` files (in root tag and feature tag).
* Remove `.qualifier` in the `category.xml` files (in feature tags, url and version).

=== 2.3) Comment any reference to the Snapshot Maven repository

=== 2.4) Update General and Contributor Readme Files

Update the content of the files `README.adoc` and `CONTRIBUTING.adoc` for using the new version numbers.

=== 2.5) Update the graphical resources

Splash screen, icons...

=== 2.6) Compiling locally without error

     $> rm -rf $HOME/.m2/repository
     $> mvn clean install

=== 2.7) Check auto-generated files

Check if the `about.mappings` files and the `SARLVersion.java` file are containing the correct version numbers.

=== 2.8) Maven Central Bundles

Prepare the bundles for Maven Central:

     $> ./build-tools/scripts/prepare-bundles-for-central.sh

Copy the bundles inside a safe folder for the Phase 3.

=== 2.9) Javadoc Generation

Generate the Javadoc for the public API (the real generation will be done by the Rake script of the website):

     $> ./build-tools/scripts/generate-aggregate-javadoc.sh

=== 2.10) Commit and push to Github

     $> git commit
     $> git push --all

=== 2.11) Tag the Git with the version number

     $> git tag "vX.Y.Z"
     $> git push --tags

=== 2.12) Release onto the SARL servers.

For uploading the release files onto the SARL server, you could use the provided script:

     $> ./build-tools/scripts/mvn-release-sarl.sh

This script needs to have environment variables for defining the SARL server addresses, and the access login.

     export MAVENSARLIO_URL=dav:https://XXX
     export UPDATESSARLIO_URL=dav:https://YYY
     export MAVENSARLIO_USER=ZZZ


== 3) PHASE 3: DISSEMINATION OF THE RELEASE VERSION

=== 3.1) Maven Central Bundles

Updload the Maven Bundle on Maven Central with http://oss.sonatype.org

=== 3.2) Debian Packages

Create and upload the debian packages.

=== 3.3) Copy on Google Drive

Copy the product, md5 and sha1 files within the Google Drive of SARL.

=== 3.3) Update the ID within Jekill

Get the download IDs of the files within Google Drive and copy them into the file `_config.yml`.
The `confirm` IDs could be obtained by downloading the archive file, then Google should complains about
a too large file, and the confirm ID is inside the download link given by Google Driver after its complain.

=== 3.4) Changelog

Create the "Changes" page for the website, and add a link to the "Changes" page of the previous website inside.
In this way, it will be possible to following the change history from the ealier to older changes.

=== 3.5) Synchronize with other projects

Synchronize the link:https://github.com/sarl/awesome-sarl[Awesome SARL project] with the "Community" page of the website.

=== 3.6) News

Add a "News" in the SARL website.

=== 3.7) Update the SARL website

     $> cd path/to/sarl-site
     $> rake build_full
     $> rake transfer

=== 3.9) Clean issues

Move all the remaining issues on Github to the following version.

=== 3.10) Close milestones

=== 3.11) Release Notes

Add release notes on Github (from the Changes page on the website), attached to the release tag.

=== 3.12) Wikipedia Review

Review the text on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARL_language

=== 3.13) Announcements

Announce the new version of SARL on:

* SARL Gitter https://gitter.im/sarl/Lobby
* Linked-in https://www.linkedin.com/
* CIAD laboratory Intranet 
* Research mailing lists 

== 4) PHASE 4: DEVELOPMENT VERSION

=== 4.1) Revert versions

Revert steps 2.1 to 2.5; and change the following:

* Version ranges in the `Required-Bundles` of `MANIFEST.MF`.
* Versions in the requirements of `feature.xml` (in root tag and in the "sarl" and "janus"" plugins references).
* Versions in the `*.product` (in root tag and feature tag).
* Versions in the `category.xml` (in feature tags, url and version).
* Uncomment the Snapshot Maven repository.


=== 4.2) Upgrade versions
